stamp_postprocess.py
====================

The ``stamp_postprocess.py`` script was tested with Python 2.7 and requires 
the xlsxwriter, openpyxl, and wx modules.

A windows executable version of the script was created using py2exe.
This enables the progam to be run without installing Python and any of
the required modules.  The command to create the executable is::

    python ./scripts/setup.py py2exe
